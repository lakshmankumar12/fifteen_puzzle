Fifteen Puzzle
===============

Attempt at doing a Fifteen Puzzle. I used to play this in Foxpro during school
days. Just realized that this is referred as Fifteen puzzle.

I referred http://mathworld.wolfram.com/15Puzzle.html[this site] to realize
that not all combinations are valid possibilites! So, we use the inversion
count as suggested here to build a valid board.

For now, no interactive support - so user has to manually type one of l/u/r/d
keys to effect moves. Pretty boring, but building arrow-key inputs into python
but retaining otherwise text layout seems painfully difficult.
